## Idea

### Agent

Overall: Input: Audio, ConfigOptions => Execute tasks => Output: Audio, ExecutionMetadata

Execute tasks with orchestration:

- Task 1: Speech-To-Text
- Task 2: Chat with AI model
- Task 3: Text-To-Speech

### Abstract

TBD

## Development

This project uses **AI-powered commit hooks** to maintain code quality and generate intelligent commit messages. See [COMMIT_HOOKS.md](./COMMIT_HOOKS.md) for detailed information about the commit hook system.

### ğŸš€ AI-Powered Commit Messages

**NEW**: Your commit messages are now generated by actual AI/LLMs! ğŸ¤–

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Use AI-powered commit (recommended)
yarn commit:ai

# Or use Git alias
git ai-commit
```

The AI analyzes your code changes and generates meaningful, context-aware commit messages using:

- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** (fast, cost-effective)
- **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (detailed analysis)

See [AI_COMMIT_GUIDE.md](./AI_COMMIT_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Set up Git aliases
./scripts/setup-git-aliases.sh

# Configure AI API key (optional)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Start development servers
yarn dev

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Format code
yarn format
```

### Available Commit Tools

```bash
# AI-Powered (recommended)
yarn commit:ai          # AI-generated commit messages
git ai-commit          # Same as yarn commit:ai

# Pattern-Based (fallback)
yarn commit:smart       # Pattern-based auto-commit
git ac                 # Same as yarn commit:smart

# Interactive
yarn commit            # Interactive commitizen
git cz                 # Same as yarn commit
```
